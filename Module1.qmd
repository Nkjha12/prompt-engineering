##  Welcome to Prompt Engineering!

In this first module, we are going to learn what **prompt engineering** means and why it is important when working with big AI language models like ChatGPT, GPT-3, GPT-4, etc.

### Prerequisite:

---

##  What is a Prompt?
A **prompt** is just a piece of text or a question that you give to an AI language model.
The model will try to complete it or give an answer based on that prompt.

## What is Prompt Engineering?

Prompt engineering means writing your prompt in a smart way so that the model gives the best and most accurate output.

You can think of it like this:

> **"If you ask the right question, you will get the right answer."**

So, prompt engineering is like the **art (and science)** of talking to AI in a way it understands better.

It helps the AI give meaningful, useful, and more correct responses just by changing how we ask.
It is especially important for powerful models like GPT-3/4, which can perform a wide range of tasks depending on how they’re prompted

### Example

#### Example 1:
Prompt: "Translate this sentence into Hindi: I teach machine learning."

Output: "Main machine learning padhata hoon."


#### Example 2:
Prompt: "What is the sentiment of this review? 'The movie was incredibly boring and a complete waste of time.'"

Output: "Negative"

###  Good vs Bad Prompt Example

BAD: Summarize the following.


GOOD: Summarize the following scientific article in 2-3 sentences using layman language.


### Why Prompt Engineering Matters

- Improves output quality and relevance
- Reduces need for retraining or fine-tuning
- Empowers non-technical users to interact with AI effectively

#  Prompt Engineering vs Fine-Tuning

| Prompt Engineering | Fine-Tuning |
|--------------------|-------------|
| No change to model weights | Adjusts model parameters |
| Fast and low-cost | Requires training resources |
| Easily deployed | Needs careful dataset curation |
