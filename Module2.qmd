##  prompting techniques or prompt patterns

- Zero-shot prompting
- Few-shot prompting
- Chain-of-thought prompting
- Instruction-style prompting
- Role prompting or persona-based prompting

Each technique gives the model better instructions, depending on what we want.

##  Zero-shot Prompting

In zero-shot prompting, we **just ask the question** or give the instruction **without giving any examples**.

###  Example:


> Prompt: "Translate to Hindi: 'How are you?'"
>  
> Output: "Aap kaise hain?"


Even though we did not show any examples, the model understood the task.
This is useful when:

- You want a quick result

- You believe the model already knows how to do the task.

## Few-shot Prompting

In few-shot prompting, we give the model a few examples before asking it to do something new. This helps it understand the pattern better.

### Example:

> Prompt:
English: Hello  
Hindi: Namaste  
English: Thank you  
Hindi: Dhanyavaad  
English: Good morning  
Hindi:

> Output:
Shubh prabhat

This method is useful when:

- You want better accuracy

- You’re not sure if the model knows the task

- You can give 2–3 examples

## Chain-of-Thought Prompting (CoT)

This is a special technique where we ask the model to think step-by-step.

### Example:
> Prompt:
>
>I went to the market and bought 10 apples. I gave 2 apples to the neighbor and 2 to the repairman. I then went and bought 5 more apples and ate 1. How many apples did I remain with?
Let's think step by step.

> Output:
>
>First, you started with 10 apples.
You gave away 2 apples to the neighbor and 2 to the repairman, so you had 6 apples left.
Then you bought 5 more apples, so now you had 11 apples.
Finally, you ate 1 apple, so you would remain with 10 apples.

Chain-of-thought helps in:

- Math problems

- Logical reasoning

- Multi-step tasks

## Instruction-style Prompting
Here, we give clear instructions in a natural language format. This is how ChatGPT and InstructGPT were trained.

### Example:

> Prompt:
>
> "Write a short summary of the movie Inception in 2-3 lines using simple English."

> Output:
>
>Inception is a sci-fi movie where people enter dreams. A team tries to plant an idea in someone’s mind through dreams.

Instruction-style prompts are useful for:

- Summarization

- Content creation

- Rewriting tasks

- Questions and answers

## Role or Persona Prompting
In this type, we ask the model to act like someone. This helps set a context or tone.


### Example:
> Prompt:
>
>"You are a nutritionist. Explain why breakfast is important to a 10-year-old."
>
>Output:
>
>Breakfast gives your body energy after sleeping all night. It helps you focus in school and keeps you strong and healthy.
