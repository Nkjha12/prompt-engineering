##  Overview

In this module, we will explore how prompt engineering can help us perform real-world tasks using language models. You will see how the same model can be used for many different applications just by changing the **prompt**.

We’ll cover:

- ✅ Text Summarization
- ✅ Text Classification (like Sentiment Analysis)
- ✅ Question Answering (QA)
- ✅ Translation
- ✅ Grammar Correction

Each section has:
- a simple explanation
- a good prompt example
- and a code example using Hugging Face's GPT-2 pipeline.

##  1. Text Summarization

**Goal**: Reduce a long paragraph into a short and simple summary.

###  Prompt Example


Summarize this paragraph in one line: 
"Artificial Intelligence is used in many fields such as healthcare, finance, and education to automate processes and improve efficiency."
