I gave 2 apples to the neighbor and 2 to the repairman. I then went and bought 5 more apples and ate 1. How many apples did I remain with? Let’s think step by step.\n\n\nOutput:\nFirst, you started with 10 apples. You gave away 2 apples to the neighbor and 2 to the repairman, so you had 6 apples left. Then you bought 5 more apples, so now you had 11 apples. Finally, you ate 1 apple, so you would remain with 10 apples.\n\nChain-of-thought helps in:\n\nMath problems\nLogical reasoning\nMulti-step tasks"

It is especially important for powerful models like GPT-3/4, which can perform a wide range of tasks depending on how they’re prompted\n\nExample\n\nExample 1:\nPrompt: “Translate this sentence into Hindi: I teach machine learning.”\nOutput: “Main machine learning padhata hoon.”\n\n\nExample 2:\nPrompt: “What is the sentiment of this review? ‘The movie was incredibly boring and a complete waste of time.’”\nOutput: “Negative”\n\n\n\n\nGood vs Bad Prompt Example\nBAD: Summarize the following.\nGOOD: Summarize the following scientific article in 2-3 sentences using layman language.\n\n\nWhy Prompt Engineering Matters\n\nImproves output quality and relevance\nReduces need for retraining or fine-tuning\nEmpowers non-technical users to interact with AI effectively"
